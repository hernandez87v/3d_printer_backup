# Thicker Cable Duct

![Vancity.Gcode Duct](Images/vancity_gcode_duct.jpg)

Thanks to [Ryan Adam](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/ryandam/Cable_management_duct) for the original and providing STEP files.

I was able to customize and make the Duct teeth thicker. In Ryan's model he has small and regular. For my V0.1 I only used regular x2 for bottom and rear midpanel. Will provide more picture in future.
